### Microservices Architecture

The Budget Management API is designed with a microservices architecture, allowing for modular development and deployment. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, providing flexibility and resilience.

1. **Authentication/User Service**: Handles user registration, login, and JWT token management (+ profile management as well).
2. **Budget Service**: Manages budgets, including creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. **Expense Service**: Manages expenses associated with budgets, including CRUD operations.
4. **Customer Service**: Manages customer data, including creation and updates.
5. **Search Service**: Provides advanced search capabilities using Elasticsearch.
6. **Order Service**: Manages orders, including creation and updates.
7. **Transaction Service**: Logs transactions for budgets and expenses.
8. **Notification Service**: Sends real-time notifications to users via WebSockets.
9. **Task Management Service**: Handles asynchronous tasks using RabbitMQ and Kafka.

This architecture allows for easy integration of additional services, such as order management, task management, and notification services, without affecting the core functionality of the API.

#### Communication Between Services

Each service communicates with others using RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging, gRPC for high-performance remote procedure calls, and REST APIs for standard HTTP communication. This ensures that services can operate independently while still being able to interact with each other as needed.

Also, the API is designed to be modular, allowing for easy addition of new services or features without disrupting existing functionality. This modularity is achieved through the use of separate directories for each service, with shared utilities and configurations in a common structure.

> [!TIP]
> Each service does not live in its own directory, but rather is organized within the main project structure. This allows for easier management and deployment of the entire application as a single unit, while still maintaining the modularity of the microservices architecture.

The CLI provides a simple way to interact with the backend API and perform various operations. It can be used for testing, debugging, and managing the application without a frontend interface or using the Swagger documentation.

## **Demo Frontend UI**

The Budget Management API includes a demo frontend UI for interacting with the backend.

It gives developers an idea of how the API can be used in a real-world application. The frontend UI is built using React, Redux, and Material-UI components.

To run the frontend UI, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies: (use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if you encounter peer dependency issues)
   ```bash
    npm install
    ```
   
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
4. Access the frontend UI at `http://localhost:3001` (or whichever port is specified in the console).

Alternatively, it is also deployed live at [https://budget-manage-app.vercel.app](https://budget-manage-app.vercel.app). Feel free to use the live version for testing and exploration.

For more information, refer to the [Frontend README](frontend/README.md) in the `frontend` directory to learn about the frontend UI components, features, and usage.

## **Swagger Documentation**

- Comprehensive API documentation is available at `/docs`.
- Includes all endpoints, schemas, and examples.
- Use Swagger UI to test and interact with the API.
- The Swagger UI looks like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/swagger.png" alt="Swagger UI" style="border-radius: 8px;">
</p>

## **GraphQL Integration**

- The Budget Management API supports GraphQL queries and mutations.
- Access the GraphQL endpoint at `http://localhost:3000/api/graphql`.
- Use the GraphiQL interface to interact with the API.
- The GraphiQL interface looks like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/graphiql.png" alt="GraphiQL" style="border-radius: 8px;">
</p>

- Interact with the API using GraphQL queries and mutations. Examples include:

```graphql
query {
  budgets {
    id
    name
    limit
    createdAt
  }
}
```

Or:

```graphql
query {
  expenses(budgetId: "64c9f8f2a73c2f001b3c68f4") {
    id
    description
    amount
    budgetId
    createdAt
  }
}
```

When you run these queries, you will receive a response with the requested data. GraphQL provides a flexible and efficient way to fetch and manipulate data from the backend. Here is an example:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/graphql.png" alt="GraphQL" style="border-radius: 8px;">
</p>

## **NGINX Configuration**

- The `nginx` directory contains an Nginx configuration for reverse proxy and load balancing.
- Use Nginx to route requests to multiple instances of the API.
- Configure SSL termination and caching for improved performance.
- The Nginx configuration looks like this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

- For more information, refer to the [Nginx documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) and the [Nginx Directory](nginx/README.md).

## **gRPC Integration**

The Budget Management API includes support for **gRPC** to enable high-performance remote procedure calls.

1. **Start the gRPC Server**:
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   node grpcServer.js
   ```

2. **Use the gRPC Client**:
   Execute the client to interact with the server:
   ```bash
   node grpcClient.js
   ```

3. **Proto File**:
   The `.proto` file for defining gRPC services and messages is located in the `protos` directory.

That's it! Your gRPC server and client should now be operational. 🚀

4. Access the Dotnet C# application at `http://localhost:5000`.

## **Continuous Integration and Deployment with Jenkins**

The Budget Management API includes a Jenkins pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.

1. **Pipeline Configuration:** The `Jenkinsfile` defines the CI/CD pipeline stages, including code checkout, dependency installation, testing, building, and deployment. Add it to the root of the project.

2. **Job Setup:** Create a pipeline job in Jenkins, point it to the repository, and configure it to use the `Jenkinsfile`.

3. **Automated Testing:** The pipeline runs `npm test` to ensure all tests pass before proceeding to the build or deployment stages.

4. **Environment Variables:** Use Jenkins environment variables to securely manage secrets like API keys and credentials for services such as MongoDB, Redis, or Render.

5. **Deployment:** The pipeline supports deploying the application using Render or directly to a server using SSH and PM2.

6. **Webhooks:** Integrate GitHub/GitLab webhooks to trigger builds automatically on code changes.

7. **Notifications:** Add Slack or email notifications in the pipeline to inform team members about build and deployment statuses.

### **GitHub Actions**

The Budget Management API also includes a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment.

1. **Workflow Configuration:** The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file defines the CI/CD workflow, including steps for checking out code, installing dependencies, running tests, and building the application.
2. **Job Setup:** The workflow is triggered on push and pull request events to the `main` branch.
3. **Automated Testing:** The workflow runs `npm test` to ensure all tests pass before proceeding to the build or deployment stages.
4. **Deployment:** The workflow can be configured to deploy the application to Render or other hosting services using GitHub Actions deployment steps.
5. **Environment Variables:** Use GitHub Secrets to securely manage sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.
6. **Notifications:** Configure GitHub Actions to send notifications to Slack or email on build and deployment statuses.

This setup allows for automated testing and deployment, ensuring that the application is always in a deployable state.
